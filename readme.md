# Changes
* - Had to insert new row in sheet1, with Song Title, etc, exactly like sheet2.
* - The highest quality results come back if I search based on Song Title AND Artist. However, if there is a typo in the artists' name, I have modified it to search by track only, which increases the chance of a mistaken or duplicate song being pulled.
